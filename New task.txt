Polling App

1. Create a basic user login/registration system.
    Based on this system, need to create polling system.
    Polling System is basically an interface from where user can create Polls.  

Example of a poll is        
Question: Who is the best cricketer in India
Options:ABC
        XYZ
        DEF
        OFG     
so basically a user can select any of the above option and submit it.

2. Pages to create
    a. Create a new Poll           
    b. View All Existing Poll          
    c. Take Poll          
these will be a standard left menu in all the above pages with opens (Create and View ALL).Only a logged in user can create a poll or view all polls.           

Create Poll Page :      
This will have a form where user can add a new poll with question and options. Also add a date picker here so that person can specificy till when the poll will be active. After that poll, it will become deactive and no one can take that poll.

View All Polls :            
This page will have a table which will show all polls created in the system. This will have paging.

Take Poll :     
Here user can take/give his answer for any poll. This answer should be recorded in database. A user can give only one unique answer for a single poll. After giving answer he should be able to see summary of all answer given by different users.
When a person gives his answer, the main admin who created this poll should get an email notification of this answer.  

Note :  important that the left menu should be a single html file. The left mene should not be repeated in different pages, rather just required
